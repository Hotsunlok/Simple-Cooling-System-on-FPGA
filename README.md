# ❄️ Simple Cooling System on FPGA  

**Board:** Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T-2FGG484 (A7-Lite 35T)  
**Language:** VHDL  
**Clock:** 50 MHz onboard oscillator  

---

## 🧠 Project Description  
This project demonstrates a **finite state machine (FSM)** implementation of a **simple cooling system** on the **Artix-7 FPGA**.  
The system uses two push buttons as inputs (`COOL`, `AC_READY`) and controls both onboard and external LEDs to indicate cooling states.
